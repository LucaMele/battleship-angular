Single Page Application with:\r\n\r\n- TypeScript http://www.typescriptlang.org/\r\n- AngularJS 1.4.* https://angularjs.org/\r\n- gulp http://gulpjs.com/\r\n- Zurb Foundation http://foundation.zurb.com/\r\n- Karma http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html\r\n- Jasmine http://jasmine.github.io/\r\n- mongoDb https://www.mongodb.org/\r\n- Node Server with Express http://expressjs.com/en/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nFirst install all npm dependencies:\r\n\r\nIf you want to use your own local db, download and install mongoDb on your system  https://www.mongodb.org/downloads. Instructions are at https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/\r\n\r\nSetup of dependencies:\r\n\r\n`npm install -g gulp        // install gulp globally. This is not mandatory because it is also declared as a npm dependency`\r\n\r\n`npm install -g bower       // install bower globally. It is not mandatory because it is also declared as a npm dependency`\r\n\r\n`npm install                // for all npm dependencies`\r\n\r\n`npm install` will also execute `bower install`, which will load all the GUI frameworks. The application will then be ready with the default task of `gulp`.\r\n   \r\nYou can trigger the task runner in the following ways:\r\n\r\n`gulp               // default task builds the app ready to run`\r\n\r\n`gulp dev           // builds the app ready and adds watchers for .ts, .scss and .html files`\r\n\r\n`gulp test          // builds the app and executes the Tests`\r\n\r\nNow you can start the server by executing the `index.js` as npm server (press play in WebStorm or press `node index.js` in your command line).\r\n\r\nYou should see the app under http://localhost:1337. You can specify the port by using the following command: `PORT=3000 node index.js`\r\n\r\nKeep aware that python (https://www.python.org) is required on your system before running npm install!\r\n\r\n\r\n## First access, temp admin on local db\r\n\r\nIf you are running your db locally and there are no other users in the collections, a first user is allowed to access with the user `admin` and password `admin`. \r\n\r\nAs soon as a newly created user exists, admin:admin will not be able to be used again to access the system. So please be\r\ncareful when creating the first user. Give him admin rights, otherwise the administration section is not accessible!\r\n\r\nDatabase configuration can be found under server/config.js\r\n\r\ndefault database setting is: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndb: {\r\n    name: 'name_of_db',             // name of the db. \r\n    host: 'localhost',              // your host\r\n    user: 'test',                   // OPTIONAL username\r\n    password: 'test',               // OPTIONAL password\r\n    port: 54288                     // port to your db\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Live demo\r\nFor a live demo, please go to: http://battleship-angular.azurewebsites.net/ \r\n\r\n\r\n##Unit tests\r\n\r\nIn order to execute unit tests, please make sure you can run karma on your machine (http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html)\r\n\r\nRun tests with the command:\r\n\r\n`gulp test`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

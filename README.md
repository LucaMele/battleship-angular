## Get Started

First install all npm dependencies:

download and install mongoDb on your system  https://www.mongodb.org/downloads and instructions are at https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/

`npm install`  

`npm install -g gulp`

`npm install -g bower`

`bower install`

and then start the application with:

`gulp`

So now you can start the server by executing the `index.js` as npm server (in webstorm just press play).

Now you sould see the app under http://localhost:3000

Keep aware that python (https://www.python.org) is required on your system before running npm install!
